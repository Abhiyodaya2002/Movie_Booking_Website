## Architecture

The movie booking app is built using the MERN stack. The app consists of multiple components, such as the Home screen, Movie Details screen, Booking screen, login/logout functionality, and Admin Panel.

The app is designed to be scalable and modular, with a clean and organized codebase. The backend API is implemented using Express.js and MongoDB, with separate controllers and models for movies, bookings, and users. The frontend is implemented using React.js, with separate components for each screen and functionality.

## Design

The appâ€™s design is modern and user-friendly, emphasizing simplicity and ease of use. The dark theme with a minimalistic font gives the app a sleek look. The app uses clear and concise labels to ensure that users can navigate it easily.

The **Home screen** displays a list of available movies, each with relevant details like title, genre, description, and showtimes. Users can select a movie to view more details. The **Booking screen** allows users to select a showtime and book tickets, while the **Admin Panel** allows administrators to manage movie listings, showtimes, and bookings.
